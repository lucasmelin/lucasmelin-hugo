During my free time [I like to read](https://literal.club/lucasmelin), do word games like the New York Times crossword or [Puzzmo](https://www.puzzmo.com) and listen to podcasts. I also like playing puzzle games, especially those made by [Zachtronics](https://www.zachtronics.com/).

## Some of my favourite podcasts

- [Talk Python To Me](https://talkpython.fm/) - great for learning about new python libraries.
- [Coding Blocks](https://www.codingblocks.net/) - I particularly like their in-depth book reviews.
- [The Changelog](https://changelog.com/) - interesting topics not focused on any particular programming stack.
- [The History of Rome](https://feeds.feedburner.com/TheHistoryOfRome) - one of my all-time favourite podcasts, covering the founding of Rome until ~476AD.
